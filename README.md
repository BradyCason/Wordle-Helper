#Wordle Helper
I original wrote functionality of the Wordle Helper in Python in 2021. The program solves the NY Times puzzle, Wordle, every time. I then created a Unity App that I deployed to my phone with a user interface. Then, in 2024, I converted the python script to JavaScript, and I created this website.
